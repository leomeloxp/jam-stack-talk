# jamstack-meetup-talk

> A Vue.js project

## Motivation

This repo contains the slides for a talk I gave at a local meetup. You can find it in blog post form in the link near the repo name as a build version of my slides is [hosted on Netlify](https://leomeloxp-jam-talk.netlify.com/). The code for the slides is provided under MIT licence, if you do decide to use any of it for your own talk or purposes I'd appreciate if you gave me a shout out ðŸ˜‰
